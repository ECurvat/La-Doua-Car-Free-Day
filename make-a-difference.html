									<h3 class="major">Some information</h3>
									<p>For too long, the car has been a revolution for societies all around the world. In the beginning, it was supposed to help us get somewhere safer and faster than with any other transport mode. Today, it isn't the case anymore. Cars are killing us more than they are helping us. Less physical activity, less fresh air, more time stuck in traffic... For information, you spend about 142 hours stuck in traffic during a single year if you live in Lyon. In 10 years, you just lost about 60 days doing absolutely nothing.</p>

									<p>All of these just pushed us three to create La Doua Car-Free Day so that we aren't just waiting to be killed but acting to stop it. You might find it odd that we think we're saving the world by not using a car one day during the year, and that's not completely false. But it isn't our goal. The only thing we want with this event is to make people aware that they don't have to use their car every day. </p>

									<h3 class="major">About us</h3>
									<p>We are three students in BUT Informatique trying to change things here in the IUT of Lyon 1. In the beginning, this project was for school purposes only. Now, we hope it snowballs, grows and expands to more places, cities or even countries. Helps us reach our goal, show your support.</p>
